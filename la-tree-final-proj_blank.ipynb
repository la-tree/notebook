    "## Purpose\n",
    "This notebook aims to explore the relationship between the percentage of modern tree canopy cover and historical 1939 redlining in Los Angeles County.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the USDA Forest Service (Grove & Locke, 2011), urban tree-canopy cover provides vital ecosystem services such as reducing summer peak temperatures and air pollution as well as providing habitat for wildlife. The presence of trees also enhances property values and offers aesthetic benefits. More importantly, by reducing summer heat temperatures, trees can mitigate the urban heat island effect, in which urban climates are warmer than the surrounding rural areas (Oke 1981).\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of modern green spaces is known to be correlated with historical redlining practices (Nardone et al. 2021). \"Redlining\" is the term for historic race-based exclusionary practices in real estate from racial steering to racial barring in many suburbs and developments in America during the 1930s. Neighborhoods were graded A (\"best\") through D (\"hazardous\") to guide bank lending policies, with predominantly White and/or affluent areas often receiving grades of A or B (Krieger et al. 2020). These actions all contributed to racial segregation and shaped the way America looks today.\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine the link between modern urban tree cover and historical redlining, we map the percentage of tree canopy cover in 2014, the grades assigned to residential areas by the federal government's Home Owners' Loan Corporation, and a composite map of both tree canopy cover and grades. We expect historical residential areas with the highest grade of A to demonstrate the highest percentage of modern tree canopy cover."

    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "### 1. [Tree Canopy in Urban and Non-Urban LA County (2014)](https://data.lacounty.gov/Sustainability/Tree-Canopy-in-Urban-and-Non-Urban-LA-County-2014-/kf6c-hxgf)\n",
    "This dataset is a combination of tree canopy data and land cover imagery data of LA County. Tree canopy data comes from [TreePeople](https://www.treepeople.org/), an environmental nonprofit that promote sustainable urban ecosystems, and the University of Vermont. The tree canopy data are a CSV file with polygon geometries from census tracts and tree canopy cover percentages for different census blocks. The Los Angeles Regional Imagery Acquisition Consortium (LARIAC) provided land cover 2014 imagery data obtained through aerial surveys. The land cover imagery data are shapefiles. We retrieved the data from the [County of Los Angeles Open Data](https://data.lacounty.gov/). One issue with this combined dataset is there is no descriptive metadata for the tree canopy data (i.e. no descriptions of variables). Metadata for the land cover 2014 imagery data can be found on [LARIAC's website](https://lariac-lacounty.hub.arcgis.com/pages/lariac5-documents-datahttps://lariac-lacounty.hub.arcgis.com/pages/lariac5-documents-data). Due to these issues, we focused on analyzing self-explanatory variables such as tree canopy (`'Can_P'`) and impervious surfaces (`'imperv_p'`). \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58&text=downloads)\n",
    "This dataset contains shapefiles of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation map for Los Angeles in 1939 illustrating the grades (A-D) for each neighborhood. We retrieved the data from the University of Richmond's [Mapping Inequality project](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58&text=downloads). All of *Mapping Inequality*'s spatial, textual, and other data are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. One issue with this dataset is that the historical spatial extent does not match up perfectly with modern LA County. There are a lot of gaps where the tree canopy cover and redlining data do not align, making it somewhat difficult to draw conclusions. "

    "Tree canopy cover and historical redlining are still relevant today. In 2019, Mayor Eric Garcetti released the Green New Deal - an ambitious plan to address environmental challenges in Los Angeles. The plan includes two primary urban forestry goals: plant 90,000 trees by 2021 and increase tree canopy in areas of greatest need by at least 50% by 2028 (Garcetti 2019). As of September 2021, over 52,000 trees have been planted (Lopez & Drechsler 2021). With approximately 40,000 trees to be planted, we could check the progress of these goals by comparing 2014 tree canopy data with the most up-to-date data. Additionally, we could compare recent tree canopy data with historical redlining to see if current tree planting efforts are considering historical discrimination."
